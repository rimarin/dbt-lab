	 * @param epoch	The epoch the tuples to be returned have to belong to.
	 * @param correlatedTuple The tuple for which the correlated tuples in the sub-plan
	 *                        below and including this operator are to be fetched. Is
	 *                        null is the case that the plan produces no correlated tuples.

	 *                                 that means that the necessary actions failed.
